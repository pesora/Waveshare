  == Development Environment ==
  * KEILMDK Version 5.12 or above.
  * Programmer/Debugger: ST-LINK V2
  * Programming/Debugginginterface: JTAG/SWD
  
  == How to use ==
  1. Connect the USB TO UART Port to your PC using a USB cable. PL2303 driver should
     be installed to the PC. 
     * Baud rate: 115200
     * Data bits: 8
     * Stop bits: 1
     * Parity: None
     * Flow control: None
  2. Connect the board to your PC through ETH interface with a net work cable.
  3. Power up and the serial port indicates the Dynamic Host IP.
  4. Enter the IP in your broswer.
  5. Click "Led control" to control the LEDs.

  == Attention ==
  * If the source code is generated by the STM32CubeMX again, there might be some undefined 
    symbols. This bug may be solved in the future version of STM32CubeMX but now (Feb. 13 2017),
    to solve the problem, you should manually modify:
    Append these lines to stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h:
      #define PHY_MICR                        ((uint16_t)0x11U)    /*!< MII Interrupt Control Register                  */
      #define PHY_MISR                        ((uint16_t)0x12U)    /*!< MII Interrupt Status and Misc. Control Register */
      
      #define PHY_LINK_STATUS                 ((uint16_t)0x0001U)  /*!< PHY Link mask                                   */
      
      #define PHY_MICR_INT_EN                 ((uint16_t)0x0002U)  /*!< PHY Enable interrupts                           */
      #define PHY_MICR_INT_OE                 ((uint16_t)0x0002U)  /*!< PHY Enable output interrupt events              */
      
      #define PHY_MISR_LINK_INT_EN            ((uint16_t)0x0020U)  /*!< Enable Interrupt on change of link status       */
      #define PHY_LINK_INTERRUPT              ((uint16_t)0x2000U)  /*!< PHY link status interrupt mask                  */
    
  */
