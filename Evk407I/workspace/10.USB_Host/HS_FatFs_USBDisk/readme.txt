  == Development Environment ==
  * KEILMDK Version£º5.12 or above.
  * Programmer/Debugger: ST-LINK V2
  * Programming/Debugginginterface: JTAG/SWD
  
  == How to use ==
  This program creates a file into a USB disk using FatFs.
  1. Attach a USB disk to the USB_HS Port on the Core board.
  2. Plug the liquid crystal display (LCD) to the LCD port.
  3. Power up and the infomation of USB Disk will be listed on the LCD.
  4. hello.txt will be created into the disk.
  
  == Attention ==
  If the source code is generated by the STM32CubeMX again, 
  the MSC Device capacity shown on the LCD will be wrong if the USB disk is 
  bigger than 4GB. 
  This bug may be solved in the future version of STM32CubeMX but now (Feb. 4 2017),
  to solve the problem, you should manually edit usbh_msc.c and change 
  int32_t --> int64_t, %lu --> %llu in these lines:
    USBH_UsrLog ("MSC Device capacity : %lu Bytes", \
    (int32_t)(MSC_Handle->unit[MSC_Handle->current_lun].capacity.block_nbr * MSC_Handle->unit[MSC_Handle->current_lun].capacity.block_size));
  to:
    USBH_UsrLog ("MSC Device capacity : %llu Bytes", \
    ((int64_t)MSC_Handle->unit[MSC_Handle->current_lun].capacity.block_nbr * (int64_t)MSC_Handle->unit[MSC_Handle->current_lun].capacity.block_size));
