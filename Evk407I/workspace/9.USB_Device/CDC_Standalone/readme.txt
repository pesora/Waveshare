  == Development Environment ==
  * KEILMDK Version 5.12 or above.
  * Programmer/Debugger: ST-LINK V2
  * Programming/Debugginginterface: JTAG/SWD
  
  == Note for STM32CubeMX ==
  1. If the project is generated by STM32CubeMX again. 
     You should set bigger heap and stack sizes, or else the USB device won't be 
     recognized by your computer. By default, the stack and heap sizes are too small.
     (Project -> Settings -> Minimum Heap Size 0x400 and Minimum Stack Size 0x800)
  2. The input frequency for HSE must be set to 8(MHz) but not 24(MHz).
  3. This statement may be incorrectly initialized in a certain version of STM32CubeMX 
     (e.g. 4.20.0):
     RCC_OscInitStruct.OscillatorType = RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSI|RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSE;
     you have to change it to 
     RCC_OscInitStruct.OscillatorType = RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSE;
     or else the oscillator won't work properly.

  == How to use ==
  1. Plug the LCD to the LCD port. 
  2. Install the STM32 Virtual COM port driver (../Software/stsw.zip)
  3. Connect the USB_FS Port on the core board to your PC with a USB cable.
  4. Open a Serial monitor software. There is no need to set the Baud rate because 
     the communication is established via USB rather than Serial Port.
  5. Serial monitor will receive strings.
  6. Messages received from PC will be shown on the LCD.
